                  <p>May 2024 - Present</p>
                  <p>
                    Deliveroo is a British multinational online food delivery company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, soon to be acquired by doordash.
                    At Deliveroo, I work as a Software Engineer on the Security Engineering team, where I get to build some of the most critical systems
                    that quietly keep everything running safely. Right now, I’m building our Identity Service, which handles all the authentication and authorization
                    across the company. It’s one of those things you don’t notice when it works, but everything breaks when it doesn’t.
                    I’m also designing a Privileged Access Management service to manage ABAC and RBAC roles for all our internal tools.
                    The goal is to make access smart, secure, and effortless for everyone who needs it. It’s challenging work, but knowing that
                    what I build protects both people and products makes it incredibly rewarding. I am using Java, Scala, AWS, terraform and Redis to build these systems.

                  <p>February 2023 - May 2024</p>
                  <p>
                    At Yubi, one of the fastest growing fintech startups in India, I worked on building a Credit Application that aimed to solve a major problem in the credit industry.
                    The traditional credit process used to take up to seven days, and what we built brought that down to just a few hours. It wasn’t just about speed — it was about
                    changing how credit moved through the system. I truly believed that my contribution would have a lasting impact on how credit companies operate across India.
                    I worked with a solid tech stack that included Java, Spring Boot, AWS, MongoDB, Kafka, and Redis. It was a challenging experience, but one that gave me a real sense of
                    purpose and growth.

                  <p>
                    Delhivery was the place where I spent the longest stretch of my career, and it played a huge role in shaping the engineer I am today.
                    It was also where I got my first promotion, which made it all the more special. During my time there, I built the backend for an onboarding application from scratch,
                    implemented digital KYC logic, and added support for manual KYC — fully owning that microservice from day one. I also worked on integrating fuel payouts for vendors
                    and contributed to the payables module. Each project taught me something new, and by the end of it, I had touched everything from infrastructure to business logic.
                    I worked with Python, Flask, AWS, Serverless, Microservices Architecture, Elasticsearch, EKS, Redis, Kafka, and even Android.

                  <p>
                    Zensar was where my journey in the tech world began. I spent around 1.8 years there, and it was the kind of foundational experience that teaches you more than just code.
                    I learned about IT ethics, Agile methodologies, and what it really means to work in a professional environment. I worked on two client-facing projects,
                    getting my hands dirty and learning how to navigate real-world challenges. My work mostly focused on the Insurance and Retail verticals, which gave me a solid
                    understanding of domain-driven development. The tech stack varied from project to project, but I primarily worked with Java and .NET.
                    It was a great place to start, and it helped set the tone for everything that came after.
